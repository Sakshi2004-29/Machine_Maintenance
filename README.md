Predictive Maintenance Model for Industrial Machinery

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based predictive maintenance system to anticipate failures in industrial machinery. By analyzing real-time and historical sensor data, the model predicts various types of machine failures such as tool wear, heat dissipation issues, and power failures. This enables proactive maintenance planning, reducing downtime and operational costs.



📚 Project Context :- 

This project was completed as part of an internship with Edunet Foundation under the IBM SkillsBuild Program. The development and deployment of this model utilized IBM Cloud tools and services, including:

● IBM watsonx.ai Studio for model training and deployment

● IBM Cloud Object Storage for storing datasets

● IBM Watson Machine Learning for model hosting and inference



🚀 Features :- 

● Ingests and processes data from sensors attached to industrial machines

● Performs feature engineering and data preprocessing

● Trains and evaluates a classification model for failure prediction

● Supports multi-class prediction (e.g., tool wear, heat issues, power failure)

● Integrates with IBM Cloud services for scalable deployment



🧰 Technologies Used :- 

● Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

● IBM watsonx.ai Studio

● IBM Watson Machine Learning

● IBM Cloud Object Storage



📈 Model Workflow :- 

● Load and clean the dataset

● Perform feature extraction and engineering

● Train a classification model (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)

● Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, and recall

● Deploy using IBM Watson Machine Learning

● Predict failure types from new real-time input data



🌐 Use Case :- 

Predictive maintenance helps industries reduce costs by avoiding unexpected failures and scheduling maintenance only when needed. This model is ideal for applications in:

● Manufacturing plants

● Energy and utilities

● Automotive systems

● Smart factories (Industry 4.0)
